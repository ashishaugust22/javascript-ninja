Event propagation happens in two ways.

1. Event Capturing
2. Event Bubbling.
To understand both the event propagation, you need to visualize html 3 div elements in tree fashion. <div>
<div>
<div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

In event capturing phase the events are triggered in first to third.
That is first eventHandler1 invoked then to eventHanlder2 to eventHandler3.

In event bubbling phase it is just reverse. While registering through, API you can register event handler with isCapture could true/false. firstEle.addEventListener("oncl1ck" , eventHanldler1 , true); Thanks, Srikanth Uppala.
